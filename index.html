            Hello, my name is Xander Ca√±edo Gonzalez! I have two last names because I am Mexican, 
            and in Mexico we carry on the Spanish naming customs of having both paternal and maternal last names. 
            I was born in New Jersey, but I have roots in San Diego, California and the city of Guadalajara
            in Mexico. However, I've called Salt Lake City home for the past 25 years. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I love to travel, eat good food, make good drinks, and generally live life to the fullest. 
            I've been with my girlfriend, Elise, for about a year and a half. She's a native Utahn hailing
            from Utah County, however she's seen what Salt Lake has to offer and likely won't be going back 
            any time soon, despite the fact that we both work in Lehi. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I work for a project management SaaS company doing white-glove tech support.
            I'm well versed in consuming our own REST API (and I'm really exicted to be working on creating them further down the course!),
            as well as waterfall, agile, and kanban mangement methodologies.  
            I work closely with our QA and Dev team because we need to collaborate so that we can deliver functionality our customers can rely on, 
            as well as a product that we can tout.
            My career path was to move to QA Automation within my company but I recently did not get a position of Quality Engineer, 
            so I've decided to take this course to expand my skills. 

            </p>
